# overwatch-current-sr
Python script that pulls HTML profile data from Blizzard's https://playoverwatch.com/, and writes the current competitive rank into a txt file.

### Notes:
- This uses Python 3.7
- script is set to update sr.txt every 480 seconds (8 mins)
- This is my first GitHub post. If something is wrong, let me know!

### Directions:
- set up line 11 with the correct information for you.
- be sure your Battle Net account is set up as "name-number" (ex. bluiey#11648 would be bluiey-11648).
